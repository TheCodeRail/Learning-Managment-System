                      My name is Akshat Jain, currently working as a Frontend
                      developer in a Banglore Startup (WorkCrew AI). I am a
                      passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in
                      computer core subjects. I specialize in the MERN stack and
                      use my skills to create dynamic and efficient web
                      applications. As a fast learner and highly motivated
                      individual, I embrace new challenges and thrive in
                      collaborative environments. I am dedicated to continual
                      growth and innovation, consistently delivering quality
                      work that exceeds expectations.
